Lesson 8 Hands On 

 

Please perform the following tasks: 

Read in your data as a CSV file: 

bikes = pd.read_csv('BisonTracking.csv') 

Look at the first seven rows of your data: 

bisontracking.head(7) 

Look at the last ten rows of your data: 

bisontracking.tail(10) 

Determine the number of rows and columns your dataset has: 

len(bisontracking) = 1107 

len(bisontracking.columns) = 5 

And answer the following questions: 

How many bison are of the species antiquus? 

bisontracking.Species.value_counts() = 633 

What is the mean and standard deviation of Length? 

bisontracking.Length.describe() =  

Mean: 7.981030 & STD: 0.808299 

What is the median length of the bison? 

bisontracking.Length.median() = 8.0
