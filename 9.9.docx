Lesson 9 Hands On 

 

Create a five element array using your favorite numbers named myFavorites. 

array1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) 

Perform each of the five aggregate functions on your array. 

array1.max() = 5 

array1.min() = 1 

array1.mean() = 3 

array1.std() = 1. 4142135623730951 

array1.sum() = 15 

Create a five element array containing only ones named OneArrayToRuleThemAll. 

OneArrayToRuleThemAll = np.ones(5) 

Add myFavorites and OneArrayToRuleThemAll. 

array1 + OneArrayToRuleThemAll 

Multiply every element in myFavorites by two. 

array1 * 2 

Call the third element in myFavorites using indexing. 

array1 [2] 

Create a four element, two-by-two matrix of numbers named TheMatrixHasYou. 

TheMatrixHasYou = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]]) 

Access the upper left element in TheMatrixHasYou using indexing. 

TheMatrixHasYou[0,0] 

Find the largest number in each row for TheMatrixHasYou. 

TheMatrixHasYou.max(axis=1) 

Reshape TheMatrixHasYou into a matrix with one row and four columns. 

TheMatrixHasYou.reshape(1,4)
